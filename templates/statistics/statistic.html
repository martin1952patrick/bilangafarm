        </p>
        <p class="bodytext" style="background-color: azure;">
            Close to 50 percent of DRC's population is primarily employed in agriculture, with more than 70
            percent of its land dedicated to growing crops. Major crops cultivated include rice, jute, wheat, tea,
            pulses, oil-seeds, vegetables and fruits.
            Yet despite agriculture contributing to such a large percentage of DRC's overall economy, it has
            remained largely subsistence based, with uncertain crop yields and inefficient infrastructure limiting
            the ability of farmers to fully commercialize
            their production. Recognizing this environment, an In-depth Country Assessment, conducted as part of the
            Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics, concluded that the DRC Bureau of
            Statistics needs to improve internal
            and external coordination with statistics producers and users. A plan focused specifically on
            agriculture is needed to complement and supplement national strategies for the development of
            statistics. Data gaps in several core areas already being
            studied such as food balance sheets, livestock and agri-environmental indicators need to be filled to
            produce more effective statistics and enable more informed responses to these issues. Amongst those
            tasked with using and analyzing statistics,
            knowledge and skills need to be further developed.

        <p class="bodytext">The Global Strategy in Africa has proposed meeting agricultural and rural statistics

        <p class="bodytext">· Develop a Strategic Plan for Agricultural and Rural Statistics (SPARS)

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext" style="background-color:azure;">Strengthened coordination mechanisms and institutional relationships have resulted in the
            DRC government preparing and adopting a strategy paper to improve agriculture and rural statistics. A
            survey calendar and integrated plan for surveys
            has also been established. A roadmap for a SPARS has also been completed and endorsed by the government. The
            roadmap has been integrated into DRC's agricultural sector development plan. The Global Strategy in
            Asia Pacific is currently collaborating
            with the government to develop a working SPARS.
